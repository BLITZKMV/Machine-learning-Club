I guess by now you wouldâ€™ve accustomed yourself with linear regression and logistic regression algorithms. If not, I suggest you have a look at them before moving on to support vector machine. Support vector machine is another simple algorithm that every machine learning expert should have in his/her arsenal. Support vector machine is highly preferred by many as it produces significant accuracy with less computation power. Support Vector Machine, abbreviated as SVM can be used for both regression and classification tasks. But, it is widely used in classification objectives.
